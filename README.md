It was a summer evening, the sunset glow of light filled the balcony, where mother holding my essays on the watch.
She read, look at me, I know she must be very want to hold my hand, I gave her.
"Look, I'm old girl can write a book."
Mother murmured, a drop of two drops of tears, then acres to falls and falls on my new book.
I could not help but SOB.
Mother closed the book and looked at it dark blue cover, said: "old girl, mama can understand.
The day of your outside so bitter, you never said.
But I understand."
I am deeply shocked.
40, if I am a fox hunter you are, you will chase after me?
If I am tea, you are boiled water, you would bubble I?
If I were a car you are drivers, would you drive me?
If you are money I am bankbook, I will take you.
